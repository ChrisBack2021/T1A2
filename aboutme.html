          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p id="aboutme">
            My name is Chris Back and I have started my transition from the
            finance industry towards the technology industry. I highly believe
            technology is the future as in my previous role as a media payables
            officer, many thing were already starting to get automated. In order
            to not fall behind, I have decided to enlist in a full-stack web
            development course and will be pursuing a career as a developer.

            <h2>My professional life</h2>
            <p>
              I worked as a account payables officer for 3 years, handling and
              reconciling over 100 different accounts with three different media
              types from overseas, digital and radio. I have experience dealing
              with internal media teams and clients as I had to communicate
              between them in order to pay invoices. During my time at Omnicom
              Media Group, I learnt how to manage my time effectively and
              efficiently as I had quite a large amount of accounts to reconcile
              every month. I was also assigned as the back up mailbox due to
              being able to multi task very well.

            <h2>A little more about me</h2>
            <p>
              I enjoy the outdoors very much. On the weekends I enjoy going
              fishing on my boat either in Sydney harbour or Botany Bay. On the
              off days on the weekend where I am not on the water, I enjoy going
              on walking tracks around the city. Every now and then, I would
              take a weekend down at the blue mountains and go exploring the
              tracks in the area, such as the Three Sisters walking track or the
              Katoomba waterfall round walking track. As I worked a desk job for
              my professional career, I found it was important to go out
              and stretch your legs and back every day, hence fitness is a big
              part of my life.
